    """
    In this animalgame aimed for children (or people with no experience in
    identifying animals) the player needs to connect the name of the animal
    i.e. "fox" with the picture of a fox by clicking on the fox image. If the
    player chooses the right animal the game progresses. There are 9 animals
    you need to find and 9 pictures of animals. The order of A) the pictures
    of the animals and B) the order you need to find them is randomized!
    Also for fun and educational purposes, when you click on an animal
    (right or wrong, we won't judge) the animal makes sounds according to the
    one pressed. Make sure you have the "sounds" and "images" folders where
    you have the python file. These files should be there when you unzip the
    .zip file, you don't have to touch anything. I've imported tkinter for
    the graphic ui, winsound to play the sound files and random for
    randoming the order of animals. When you find all the animals the game
    asks if you want to play the game again (randomizing the orders again) or
    just quit. This project was trying to be an advanced project. I hope you
    won't disagree.
    Have fun playing!
